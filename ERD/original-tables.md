# Original (Unnormalized) Tables

This file captures the original, pre-normalization table specification used as the starting point for
the 3NF analysis. It is intentionally simple and contains some composite or repeated fields that were
later decomposed in `normalization.md`.

Below is the original specification (kept as a reference so migrations can be planned):

```text

Notes:
- This original model was intentionally straightforward to capture functional requirements quickly.
- Fields such as `full_name` and `location` are composite and were split into atomic columns in the normalized design.
- Use this file when drafting migration queries to map old columns to the new normalized tables.

## 2. `ERD/original-tables.md`

This file details the initial, unnormalized specification before the 3NF analysis.
